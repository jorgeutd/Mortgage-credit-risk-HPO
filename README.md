# Mortgage credit risk HPO modeling

I am using Tune-sklearn from ray here primarily for tuning Scikit-Learn models with cutting edge hyperparameter tuning techniques. I bechmarked my results against the pycaret auto ml framework. This was some of the code for my class DAAN 888. I only adding the initial EDA & HPO (hyperparameter optimization) notebook here.



## Dataset

The dataset used was obtained from creditriskanalytics.
